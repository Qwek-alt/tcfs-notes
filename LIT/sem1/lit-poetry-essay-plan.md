> Question: Robert Frost’s poem “The Tuft of the Flowers” shows us that humans are never really separate from each other. Discuss.

# Outline
## Introduction
**Background information (definitions of terms):** The word ‘separate’ is used to describe things or people that are completely disconnected or detached from each other; thus existing or living in isolation and loneliness. However, people are never really separate when they may seem disconnected or apart, but are actually connected in some way or another, whether it be physically, mentally or spiritually.
Humans are separate when they are kept apart, disconnected and detached from each other and do not have anything that connects them
‘separate’: to set or keep apart; disconnected; detached
‘never really’: although people may seem to be separate/apart (literally/physically), they are actually connected in some way or another

**Thesis statement:** In this essay I will argue that Robert Frost’s use of … in his poem “The Tuft of the Flowers” creates/shows/argues/illustrates … for the audience/reader

In this essay I will argue that Robert Frost’s poem “The Tuft of the Flowers” shows the reader that no matter how isolated we may seem to be in the world, we are never truly alone because humanity is always connected by the similarities that we have with each other. 

**Outline:** First the essay will investigate the spiritual journey which the speaker takes and the change that the speaker goes through, next it will analyse what the butterfly and the flowers symbolise in the poem, following that it will analyse the poem structure and finally it will show how the poem’s ideas relate to the times that we live in today. 

## Body 1
* **Topic sentence/Main Claim:** the spiritual journey which the speaker takes and the change that the speaker goes through
* **Evidence (quotation):**
  * The poem can be separated into two parts: couplets one to thirteen and couplets fourteen through 21. 
* **Explanation/Analysis:** 
  * The first part of the poem emphasises on the theme of loneliness and how humans are never truly together
    * A heightened sense of isolation is created
      * The mower uses his scythe to create a “leveled scene” of destruction
      * Nature has been wiped clean by man
    * The second part of the poem replaces all ideas from the first part and illustrates the togetherness of humanity and how humans are never truly separate
* **Link:** 
  * Change/Contrast
    * The poem brings us on a spiritual journey
    * Two parts: c1-13→ c14-21
    * Theme change: loneliness → togetherness
    * Idea change: humans are never truly together → humans are never truly apart
    * Tone change: negative → positive
    * First part:
      * Couplet 2: “levelled scene”
      * Couplet 4: “--alone”
    * This change from __ to __ actually emphasises the latter idea
      * Counter-argument: One could argue that the latter half of the poem is the speaker’s delusion of unity and that it is a form of irony that undermines the speaker’s irony - that the whole poem is about how we are forever alone in the world and that Frost is actually making a fool out of the speaker for making such a drastic change in his/her mindset
    * Repetition of rhyme heart-apart
      * First time c5
      * Second time: c21
      * This reiteration emphasizes the change - the speaker repeats the same rhyme to further emphasise that he/she has changed his/her mind completely - forget about what i said before; this is what i am saying now

## Body 2
* **Topic sentence/Main Claim:** what the butterfly and the flowers symbolise in the poem
* **Evidence:** 
* **Explanation/Analysis:** 
* **Link:** 
* Butterfly/Flowers symbol
  * The butterfly is a guide
    * Connotations: natural, spiritual, metamorphosis and change - foreshadowing the change in which the speaker goes through
  * Flowers
    * ‘Leaping tongue of bloom’
      * Symbol of human connection
      * Feelings in the speaker’s body/mind/psyche are the same as that of the mower
      * Like the mower is talking to the speaker through the flowers
      * They share the admiration of the beauty of the flowers
      * Empathy between the mower and the speaker - the mower spared the flowers and the speaker knows why

## Body 3
* **Topic sentence/Main Claim**: the poem structure
* **Evidence:** 
* **Explanation/Analysis:** 
* **Link:** 
  * Poem structure
    * 21 couplets; Paired iambic pentameter; Rhyme scheme: aa,bb,cc…
    * The lines of the poem are never truly alone as each line is paired up with one other line with the same rhyme. it cannot be denied that the lines are never truly alone and even though the couplets may be separate from each other, like how we as humans may sometimes be categorised by our differences, the lines in the couplets are still never alone as each line is always with another line and they both share the same rhyme - this is once again parallel to humans and no matter how isolated we may feel, we are never truly alone as someone else, somewhere in the world has similarities with you
      * The structure of the poem reflects the paradox of unity in isolation once again
    * The iambic pentameter of stressed and unstressed words is similar to the sound of a heartbeat - connotations of emotions, love and feeling -- further emphasising on the similarity that all human beings on earth have: the fact that we all have physical hearts and the fact that we all have similar emotions and feelings
## Body 4
* **Topic sentence/Main Claim**: how the poem’s ideas relate to the times that we live in today
* **Evidence:**
* **Explanation/Analysis:** 
* **Link:** 
  * Relation to the times we live in today
    * COVID-19
      * The poem reminds us that even though circumstances may force us to be physically isolated/apart/distant from each other, we are actually still very much connected as we go through the same experiences, emotions and struggles.
      * Creates unity in isolation
    * Countries/War
      * The poem questions the distinction of countries/groups and the wars that some countries/groups have against each other
      * We should not be at war with each other as we have more in common than not
      * Working together is much better for humanity than having war with each other which brings suffering to both parties (commonality of suffering)


## Conlclusion
* **Restate thesis statement**
