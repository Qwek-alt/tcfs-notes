- Climate Change [~definition](link_generated_on_download):: changes in the Earth's climate (such as precipitation, temperature, changes in the seasons, changes in weather patterns, increase in frequency and the extent of extreme weather events) #~definition
    - [~examples](link_generated_on_download) #~examples
        - rising sea levels
        - [Global Warming ~definition](link_generated_on_download)  
        - ice melting in poles
- Global Warming [~definition](link_generated_on_download):: increase in the Earth's average surface temperature due to anthropogenic activities; Refers to the upward temperature change across the entire earth particularly since the 1970s due to greenhouse emissions #~definition
    - consequences
        - rising temperature
        - rising sea levels
        - melting glaciers and icecaps
        - changing ecological patterns
            - plant and animal distribution
            - crop yields
            - warming and acidification of oceans
- reasons why coral reefs are dying
    - increase in sea temperature or warming of oceans - what water temperatures increase, the coral expel the zooxanthelle which provide them with food and colour 
    - ocean acidification - where carbon dioxide mixes with water to create carbonic acid which threatens the development of coral
- Greenhouse Effect [~definition](link_generated_on_download):: Overall average weather at a place over a period of time (decades) #~definition

- Difference between [Greenhouse Effect ~definition](link_generated_on_download) and [Enhanced Greenhouse Effect ~definition](link_generated_on_download) #[[Enhanced Greenhouse Effect [~definition](link_generated_on_download)]] 
    - Greenhouse Effect occurs naturally allowing life to exist on planet Earth. Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be too cold for living things to exist on
    - Enhanced Greenhouse Effect  refers to a greater amount of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere which is contributing to the warming of the Earth's surface
- Greenhouse Gases
    - Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
        - [~stat](link_generated_on_download) responsible for{{ two thirds}} of additional warming caused by GHGs emitted  
        - [~stat](link_generated_on_download)CO2 levels have risen from {{295 }}ppm in 19000 to{{ 408 }}ppm at the present time   
        - sources
            - fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)
            - breathing
            - air conditioner
            - deforestation
                - Forests absorb CO2, but when they are cut and burnt produce COâ‚‚ so deforestation has a double impact
    - Methane
        - [~stat](link_generated_on_download) {{21 }}times more powerful as a GHG than CO2  
        - [~stat](link_generated_on_download) can stay in the atmosphere for about{{ 12years}}
        - breaks down into carbon diaoxide (methane + oxygen --> carbon dioxide + water)
        - sources
            - farming: grazing cattle on a large scale
            - decomposing waste
    - Nitrogen Oxide
    - Water Vapour
    - CFCs
        - man-made chemical compound - not natural
        - [~stat](link_generated_on_download)   CFCs contribute to the depletion of the Ozone layer (as {{1}} CFC molecule destroys {{100,000}} ozone molecules)
        - The Montreal Protocol internationally banned the use of CFCs
        - the only link between [Global Warming ~definition](link_generated_on_download)  and  [Ozone layer](link_generated_on_download)  
        - sources
            - arrosols
            - refridgeration plants
    - three most significant greenhouse gases affected by anthropogenic activity (from most significant to least significant)
        - [Water Vapour](link_generated_on_download)  
        - [Methane](link_generated_on_download)  
        - [Nitrogen Oxide](link_generated_on_download)  
    - compare the contribution of developed and developing countries to greenhouse gas levels:: developed countries have a much higher carbon footprint than developing countries
    - why will developing countries be most impacted by a 2 degree rise in temperatures?
        - less able to manage changes in agricultur
        - low lying coasts and islands (Papua New Guinea-Cataret Islands) liable to increased flood risk with rising sea levels, storm surges, increasing number of cyclones and hurricanes and loss of food supply
- Anthropogenic Climate Change
    - Species impacted by anthropogenic climate change
        - polar bear
            - warming of the Artic has led to decline in sea ice, shortening the hunting area and availability of seals the major source of food for the polar bears.
            - Changes of rainfall patterns may lead to collapse of den roofs, leaving mothers and polar bear cubs exposed to the elements and predators.
            - Lack of sea ice means that some of the polar bears are drowning as they search for food
        - orang utans
            - Climate change is placing additional pressure on the rainforests of Indonesia. Climate models suggest that higher rainfall can be expected across the region, thereby accentuating flooding and landslides.
            - Increased rainfall could impact plants the orangutans rely on for food.
            - Drought could lead to more intense forest fires making both the forest more vulnerable and putting the orangutans at further risk.
        - giant panda
            - at risk from climate change due to the potential shifting distribution of bamboo forests. This is particularly important given the fragmented nature of panda populations.
        - sea turtles
            - sex changes due to the higher temperature of the sand in which the turtle eggs are incubated
- Ozone layer
    - function:: absorb the sun's harmful UV radiation that can alter DNA and cause cancer, protects life on Earth
