- explain how the Green economy can be a solution to some of the impacts of globalisation:: **Avoid resource scarcity** by shifting to a low carbon economy, **using resources much more efficiently** and** making sure people are included in society**. This would include jobs in **renewable energy supply** reducing carbon emissions,** electric vehicle technology, sustainable buildings** etc.
