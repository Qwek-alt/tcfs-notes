- Muiltilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) [~definition](link_generated_on_download):: a legally binding agreement between several States related to the environment #~definition
  - requires that countries develop/implement specific mechanisms and fulfill obligations involving reporting, training, public education etc.
  - various terms that are used in MEAs
    - agreement ([~examples](link_generated_on_download) Paris Agreement; Gorilla Agreement)
    - convention ([~examples](link_generated_on_download) Convention to Combat Desertification)

  - [Key Achievements](link_generated_on_download) #[[Key Achievements]]
    - legally bound signatories to greenhouse gas emission targets
    - industrialised countries were tasked to reducing their emission (on average) by 5% by 2012
    - international agreement linked to the UNFCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)
  - [Criticisms](link_generated_on_download) #Criticisms
    - emission targets were different for each country
    - Australia was the highest per capita ratio of GHG emissions in the world but were able to ask for an increase because of growing population and industry base
    - USA did not ratify the Protocol (they are responsible for 36.1% of carbon emissions)
    - by the time the protocol became international law, emissions had risen dramatically
    - developing and newly industrialised countries has no set targets
- Paris Agreement #MEO
  - [Year](link_generated_on_download):: 2015 #Year
  - [Key Achievements](link_generated_on_download) #[[Key Achievements]]
    - aim to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees celsius, aiming at a 1.5 degree celsius increase
    - developed countries to provide US$100 billion from 2020 to assist developing countries meet their targets
    - aim to eliminate coal, oil and gas aas energy sources
  - [Criticisms](link_generated_on_download) #Criticisms
    - not mandated how much individual countries should reduce its GHG emissions by
    - each country must set their own goals and explain how they will be reached
    - no penalties for any country that does not comply and meet their own targets
    - individual countries are yet to decide if they will ratify the agreement
      - unless at least 55 different countries ratify the Paris Agreement, it will not come to effect at all
      - nations that do ratify the agreement must account for 55% of all greenhouse gas emissions

- National Level Responses
  - switch to renewable energy
  - provide efficient and accessible public transport which runs on green energy
  - have building regulations that incorporate energy efficiency promote recycling and waste minimisation practices
  - reforestation and afforestation
  - carbon sequestration:: the long-term storage of carbon in deep basins or plant, soils, geologic formations, and the ocean
    - carbon sequration issues
      - needs more energy to inject it 1km underground
      - there is 50km^3 to bury each day globally
      - must be monitored in case it escapes
      - THEREFORE - forests are the best long-term vegetation storage
  - sustainable building design
    - use of natural light
    - double-glazing on all windows
    - automatic lighting controlled by sensors
    - use of recycled building materials
    - rainwater harvesting
    - onsite electricity generation
    - facilities available for staff, bicycle storage, showers
-
- carbon sequestration
- double glazing
- energy efficiency
