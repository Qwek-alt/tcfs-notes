- what is the difference between biocapacity and ecological footprint?

    - biocapacity is the amount of land the Earth can provide for each of us to support our daily lives
    - ecological footprint is demand and biocapacity is supply
- Biophysical Environment: the biotic and abiotic surrounding of an organism or population
- Ecosystem : a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment
- NGO : a non-profit organization that operated independently of any government,  typically one whose purpose is to address a social or political issue
