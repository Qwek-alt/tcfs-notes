- Climate VS Weather
    - Climate [~definition](link_generated_on_download)  
- Conquences of Enhanced Greenhouse Effect
    - Increased rate of malaria - because of increased mosquito population
    - Climate changes
        - drier in some places
        - wetter in othe rplaces
        - more extreme weather events
        - more frequent floods, droughts, cyclones, typhoons, storms, heatwaves etc.
    - who is most affects by consequences?:: the poor
- Hazards [~definition](link_generated_on_download):: situations that have the potential to cause harm to people and/or the environment ([~examples](link_generated_on_download) volcano) #~definition
    - Hazard Event [~definition](link_generated_on_download):: occurs when the potential to cause harm by a hazard is realised ([~examples](link_generated_on_download) Volcanic eruption) #~definition

                - Bushfires [~definition](link_generated_on_download):: fires that burn out of control in grassland or forest #~definition
                    - causes
                        - strong correlation between drought and bushfires - 
                    - types of bushfires
                        - grassfires - spread along flat areas covered in grasses or scrubland  
                        - forest fires - occur in forests and woodland
                    - factors affecting bushfire behaviour
                        - climate - Particular regions are more fire-prone due to the amount of rainfall and the average temperatures
                        - temperature - hot, dry weather will dry fuel and encourage fire to spread, especially if high temperatures are prolonged
                        - wind - dry winds can feed a fire, increase its speed, dry fuel and spread embers which can then start new fires
                        - topography - fires burn faster up steep, forested slopes as flames can reach more unburnt fuel and radiant heat pre-heats higher fuels
                        - fuel load - large amounts of dry, flammable fuels such as grasses, leaf litter and scrub increase the magnitude of a fire

                - Tropical Cyclone   
                - Floods[~definition](link_generated_on_download):: an accumulation of water over normally dry land #~definition
                    - how/why floods occur
                        - as climate becomes warmer, we are likely to experience more rainfall
                        - when ranfall quantities are very large over a short period of time, the soil quickly becomes saturated and is unable to absorb all of the water
                        - run-off water increases, overwhelming the capacity of creeks, rivers and drainage systems
                    - [~stat](link_generated_on_download) For every {{1}} $$ \degree C $$$$$$ increase in temperature, the atmosphere can hold an extra {{7}} % of water vapour
                    - types of flood
                        - slow-onset floods
                        - rapid-onset floods
                        - coastal floods
                        - flash floods
