# Climate Change
* Climate change:: large-scale environmental challenge
  * stems from the resource-intensive lifestyles in urban environments/cities
* Stats
* next 30 years
  * doubling in urban population
  * doubling in urban infrastructure
  * \>5x current global GDP will be invested to urban infrastructure
# City: Vancouver, Canada
* Priority/key areas of focus for sustainability
  * Goal:: to run the city on 100%  renewable energy by 2050
  * 10 targets (Green city action plan)::
    * green economy
    * climate leadership
    * green buildings
    * green transportation
    * zero waste
    * access to nature
    * lighter footprint
    * clean water
    * clean air
    * local food
    * Reference: https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Greenest-city-action-plan.pdf
* Examples
  * 150 city policy initiatives examples::
    * big farms in the middle of the city
    * waste recovery
    * renewable energy technologies
      * described as "disruptive" by many experts - why::
        * they are radically different from current, conventional technologies
        * better for consumers and society
        * therefore they will "disrupt" current paradigms
    * green economy
  * green jobs ü†ï19%
  * water usage ü†ó18%
  * GHG emissions ü†ó because
    * ü†ïbiking
    * ü†ïwalking
    * ü†ïpublic transit
  * solar energy
    * growth ü†ï40%/year
  * electric vehicles
    * Californian electric vehicle policy
      * 10% of vehicles sold must be electric
      * GHG ü†ó80%
  * Vancouver Convention Centre sustainable features
    * 6 acre living/green roof
    * black water recycling treatment plant
    * sea water heating and cooling
# City: Seoul, South Korea
* Priority/key areas of focus for sustainability
  * Goal:: 20% electricity self-reliance by 2020
  * One Less Nuclear Power Plant campaign
    * run by the Seoul Metropolitan Government
    * to reduce the amount of energy produced by one nuclear power plant through
      * citizens‚Äô energy saving efforts
      * production of green energy such as solar power
    * reference: Seoul Sustainable Energy Action Plan | OLNPP Seoul Sustainable Energy Action Plan
  * environmental transportation
  * citizen engagement and participation
* Examples
  * subways
  * bikes
  * Renewable Energy
    * AMSA Photovoltaic Power Plant
      * solar panels installed on top of filtering reservoir of the water purification plant
        * cooling effect
          * makes solar panels more efficient
        * average power generation hours: 3.1-3.2hrs/day ‚ûù 3.7-3.8hrs/day
      * contributes to the One Less Nuclear Plant campaign
  * Passive Design
    * allows nature to cool and heat buildings by ensuring that energy does not leak through walls and creating an optimal envelope
    * features to create optimal envelope
      * lots of insulation
      * special glass
      * special curtain walls
    * other features
      * green wall
        * brings nature into urban environment
        * elevates mood and relieves stress
      * roof-top solar panels
# City: Gothenburg, Sweden
* Priority/key areas of focus for sustainability
  * cooperation with academia and financial sector
  * Consumption-based carbon footprint
    * products and services that cause emissions in other countries or other parts of Sweden
    * traditional view
      * transport
      * energy production
      * industry
    * Gothenburg's consumption based view
      * consumption of food
      * air travel
      * etc.
* Examples
  * Green bonds [2008]
    * guarantees that money is invested in sustainable projects
    * Gothenburg - first city to issue green bonds
    * Investment examples
      * electric cars
      * biogas production
      * water purification filter
  * Sustainable Lifestyle Scandinavia
    * example of how to help bridge the gap between private and public sectors
    * Chongyang County, China
    * private capital fuels sustainable expansion of the city
      * creation of electric bus with Volvo
# City: Paris, France
* Priority/key areas of focus for sustainability
  * sustainable mobility
  * renewable energy
  * reintroducing nature
  * Sustainable Development Action Network::
    * green energy
    * strengthen the retrofit plan to mitigate GHG emissions
    * tackle energy poverty
    * 10% of Paris' population involved
* Examples
  * promoting soft mobility
    * incentives to shift to sustainable mobility
      * clean electric vehicles
      * electric bicycles
    * program that forbids most polluting cars by 2020
  * nature
  * circular economy
  * sustainable enrgy
# Cape Town & Tshwane, South Africa
* Priority/key areas of focus for sustainability
  * sustainable development
  * poverty
  * social inequality
  * unemployment
* Examples
