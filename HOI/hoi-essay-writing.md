# Thesis Statement Exercise: Bad, Better, Good and Best
Question: How reliable is Augustus' own explanation of his actions?
<table>
   <tr>
      <td>BAD</td>
      <td>“Augustus gave an explanation for his own actions and I will discuss it in this essay.”</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>BETTER</td>
      <td>“Augustus gave an explanation for his own actions and I will discuss whether or not it is reliable.”</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>GOOD</td> 
      <td>“The Res gestae written by Augustus is not, I will argue, a reliable document because he was trying to persuade others that he was a better person than he actually was.” </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>BEST</td>
      <td>“Through a comparison of writings by Tacitus, Suetonius and Augustus, I will argue that the Res gestae was an unreliable piece of propaganda which overstates Augustus' achievements, ignores his brutality, and lies about his political plotting. This claim is made stronger when we understand that the Res gestae was written by Augustus to appear on his own tomb.”</td>
   </tr>

# General rules for quoting/paraphrasing
1. ✅ Paraphrase secondary sources
2. ✅ Quote primary sources
3. ✅ Short, impactful quotes
4. ❌ Long-ass quotes

# Other Notes
* NO COUNTER-ARGUMENTS ~ 'why would you waste your words on weakening your argument?'
* when in doubt, put a reference to the primary source - too many references are never enough lol
* there is no 'correct answer' to the question - just your answer and your justification. how well you justify your answer with evidence determines the mark
* answers don't necessarily have to be 'agree or disagree' - it could be 'partial agreement' or 'i don't know and here are the reasons why nobody knows the answer'
* Avoid cliches like "in conclusion" or "to conclude" or "first...second...next...lastly..."
