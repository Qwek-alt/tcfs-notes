# [Tutorial] Adam Smith Handout
1. What laws and principles does Adam Smith believe drive human society?
   * “This is what is done by whoever offers another person a bargain of any kind. Give me that which I want, and you shall have what you want. That is the meaning of every such offer.”  
   * concern for their own interest
2. What does Smith think motivates human and economic behaviour?
   * Self-interest
   * Humans have an almost constant need for the help of others
3. What does Smith think are ‘wrong’ economic actions of individuals or governments? Why?
   * He believed that government intervention should be kept to an absolute minimum because free trade was essential for economic growth since self-interest is the most important motivator for economic activity.
   * Interferes with the equilibrium of natural liberty that a free market 
4. What is the ‘invisible hand’? How does it operate according to Smith?
   * It is an unobservable market force that benefits an individual’s self-interested actions.
   * A metaphor for how an individual exchanging money in their own self-interest unintentionally impacts the economy as a whole
5. Is Smith more concerned with the benefit of the individual, or the benefit of society?
   * He is more concerned with the benefits of individual
   * —“By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectively than when he really intends to promote it.”(p. 17)
   * individuals who pursue their own interests will inevitably benefit society as a whole
6. What is laissez-faire capitalism?
   * The government is less involved in the economy and it is believed that society as a whole will benefit from less intervention.
7. Why should governments NOT interfere in the market? What are the three legitimate roles of government?
   * Three legitimate roles of government (p.18)
     * Duty of protecting the society from the violence and invasion by other societies <army and police>
     * Duty of administration of justice-protecting, as far as possible, every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other member of it <legal system>
     * Duty of building and maintaining certain public works and certain public institutions <infrastructure>
8. [BONUS] Using the interwebs, find out what some of the limitations of the ‘invisible hand’ are.
   * It can be easily limited or stifled by natural beliefs. It does not actually act “intelligently” but it acts with a herd mentality 
9. [BONUS BONUS] Using the interwebs, find some other examples of positive and negative externalities.
   * Positive externalities- Development of new technologies by companies become freely available to other people 
   * Negative externalities- The passive smoking endured by trains to people who live nearby mass transit system
10. [BONUS BONUS BONUS] Using the interwebs, find out what some of the limitations of the ‘Invisible hand’, are in particular: what are public goods?
    * Public good: commodity or service that is made available to all members of a society
    * Public goods have two distinct aspects—"nonexcludability" and "nonrivalrous consumption." Nonexcludability means that nonpayers cannot be excluded from the benefits of the good or service.
    * Limitation: free-rider problem
      * If an entrepreneur stages a fireworks show, for example, people can watch the show from their windows or backyards. Because the entrepreneur cannot charge a fee for consumption, the fireworks show may go unproduced, even if demand for the show is strong.
11. [BONUS<sup>4</sup>] One of the key ideas of laissez-faire economics and the invisible hand is that it is an excellent way of distributing resources. Do  you agree with this? Why? Or why not?“
    * No, I don’t agree
