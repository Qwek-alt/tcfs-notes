# Political Philosophy
* Enlightenment ideas inspired new approaches to politics, particularly the idea of systems based on the 'natural rights' of man: liberty and equality 
* Central questions 
    * What gives government its authority? 
    * What should a government be allowed to do? 
    * What makes a 'good' government? 
    * When do you have a right to disobey the government? 
* Enlightenment thinkers questioned the idea of hereditary hierarchy determined by God, developed from a Christianized version of Aristotle's idea of 'ladder of life', including the ideas of : 
    * Inherited power of nobles by right of birth 
    * "Divine Right" of kings, ie: that they had been given their right to rule by God 
    * Idea that hierarchy was natural and equality unnatural 

# Political Systems from the Middle Ages to the Late 18th Century
* Around 1700, Euopean political systems were based on tradition and religious belief 
    * Royalty 
        * blood descendants of Medieval kings, said to rule "by divine right" 
    * Hereditary Aristocracy 
        * land-owning descendants of Medieval feudal lords, believed to be 'better' than common people 
    * Non land=owning classes 
        * including middle classes 
            * traders and manufacturers 
        * and lower classes 
            * farm workers, tenants, servants, etc. 
        * mostly with little or no political power 
* Example: the Ancien Regime 
    * French rulers were "absolute monarchs" (eg. Louis XVI) 
    * Three estates 
        * the clergy 
        * the nobility 
            * 0.4% of population 
            * 30% of land 
            * controlled public offices 
            * exempt from most taxes 
        * anyone not in the first two  
            * vast majority of the population 
            * had to pay taxes 

# John Locke and The Social Contract
* Major figure in the Enlightenment 
* Argued that human beings has a natural right to life, liberty (freedom), and estate (property, wealth) 
* Social Contract theorist 
    * the legitimacy of government comes from the consent of the governed 
* Other social contract theorists: Hobbes (1588-1679); Rousseau (1712-1778) 
* Argues that people would consent to give up some natural freedoms to from a government in order to best serve their interests (for Locke = protect natural rights) 
* This means the government must act for the interests of the governed. If the government does not fulfill its part of the contract, revolution is justified 
* Locke is a key thinker in liberalism - political theory that claims individual freedom is the most important political goal 

# Influence on Revolutions
* The American Revolution of 1775-6 and the French Revolution of 1789 resulted in the first Western representative democratic national governments 
    * American Revolution against British rule was directly influenced by Locke and social contract theory: "No taxation without representation" 
    * French Revolution also inspired by Enlightenment ideas of liberty, equality and reason - though more complex 
    * Moderate phrases influenced by Locke and Montesquieu 
    * 'The Terror' influenced by Rousseau 
* The French Revolution also influenced by the Enlightenment value of reason - eg: the revolutionary calendar and the 'rational' death of the guilotine 

# [Tutorial] John Locke's Political Philosophy
1. What is the State of Nature for Locke?
   * The state of nature is one that has a law of nature to govern it, which is reason. He argued that people have ‘natural rights’ (rights that do not depend on society) to life, liberty and private property, and also the right to punish those that violate these rights

2. What rights does Locke think we are born with (ie. natural rights that we have even without a government?)
   * Life, liberty and private property, and also the right to punish those that violate these rights

3. Why does he think we would agree to giving up some of these to join a political society? What is this called?
   * ‘This’ is the Social Contract
   * Because all men are equal and most of them do not strictly respect [the principles of] equity and justice.  ———— it is called “property”

4. What are the parallels in the US Declaration of Independence  with Locke’s argument?
   * Locke’s state of nature is parallel with the phrase
     * “...given by God certain rights which cannot be taken away”
     * They all pointed out that everyone is equal
   * Locke argues that the right to govern came from the consent of the people and was based in a social contract
   * So if the people do not give consent, they have the right to overthrow their government ~ resistance to authoritarianism
     * “...whenever any form of government destroys those aims, *it is the right of the people to change or abolish the government*, and set up a new one based on principles and an organisation which the people think will bring them safety and happiness”
     * “When there is a series of abuses of power…, *it is the people’s right… to get rid of the government and protect their security*”

5. What are the particular claims made against the system of government in the Declaration of Independence?
   * Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government
   * Resistance to authoritarianism
     * The government is supposed to protect the peoples’ rights - if they do not protect the people rights - the people can overthrow the government
     * “...whenever any form of government destroys those aims, *it is the right of the people to change or abolish the government*, and set up a new one based on principles and an organisation which the people think will bring them safety and happiness
     * “When there is a series of abuses of power…, *it is the people’s right… to get rid of the government and protect their security*”

6. Is the Declaration of Independence an expression of Enlightenment ideas?
   * Yes
