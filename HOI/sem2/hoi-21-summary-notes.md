# [Tutorial] Imperalism and Darwinism
1. What is an empire?
   * A large political unit often made of many peoples or nations, usually created by conquest and
divided between a dominant centre (the "home" territory of the rulers or overlords) and often
subordinate far-flung territories ruled from the centre.
2. What is imperialism?
   * The set of ideas and beliefs and actions that created, maintained and justified empires and
argued for the control of one people over others.
3. What is colonialism?
   * The political system of rule by one group over another and where this group believed that,
usually because of conquest, it had an exclusive right to sovereignty over the other and to
determine their destiny. This was usually, though not always, done from a distance
   * Colonialism emerges in Europe as a method of bringing territory (including the people of that
territory and the resources of that land) under a central control
4. What is colonisation?
   * Large-scale population movements from the home country to the colonies under its control,
where these colonists retained strong connections to their ancestors' former country, and which
gave them significant privileges over the original inhabitants of the colonised areas.
5. What are some of the justifications that imperial nations used for colonialism and empire?   * Able to bring law, order and industry to nations and raise them to a position of equality with
other nations.
   * Bringing Christianity and education to colonised people seen as Christian duty.
   * Saw their role as a civilising mission, bringing true culture to the uncultured few
6. What is the relationship between race and imperialism?
   * Race, and the definition of some peoples as biologically inferior and others superior, became
a dominant feature of imperialism, as the process of imperialism and colonisation seemed to
conform for many Europeans the theory that white westerners were superior to all others.
7. Using the internet and the iBook, describe the philosophy of positivism. What ideas did it have
about society (and race)? [Darwinism and race iBook, pp.6-7][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism] [Church of Humanity] [Religion of Humanity]
   * Auguste Comte
   * Positivism describes an approach to the study of society that specifically utilizes scientific
evidence such as experiments, statistics and qualitative results to reveal the truth about the way
society functions.
   * This led to a thinking about humans as biological creatures governed by natural law
   * One outcome of this new thinking was to see the history of human development as having
some purpose, as leading to triumph of civilisation, which of course was understood to mean the
civilisation of Europe at that time
   * This shaped a hierarchical and racist society
   * Evolutionary ladder - primitive peoples (Africans, Asians) were links between primate
species and European civilisation
