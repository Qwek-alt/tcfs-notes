# [Tutorial] Karl Marx and The Industrial Revolution
1. Who did Marx think was the ruling class? Who were they?
   * Bourgeoisie, those who owns ‘capital’,  the means to create wealth within a capitalist system
2. Who did Marx think was the underclass? Who were they?
   * Proletarians, those who work for wages within a capitalist system
3. What is class struggle? (Bonus questions- what is the mode of production? Who did Marx think should own the means of production?)
   * “oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.“
   * “Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat”
4. In section1 on page 16 he gives four examples of oppressor and oppressed. Which periods of Western history do you think these come from?
   * Ancient Greece - freeman and slave
   * Rome - patrician and plebeian
   * Middle ages - lord and serf; 
   * Renaissance/Medieval - Guild Master and journeyman
5. In what ways was Marx inspired by the Scientific revolution/Enlightenment?
   * Scientific revolution - principle laws
6. What does Marx mean by the term ‘superstructure’?
   * “Marx theorized that all ‘culture’ -- including political, legal, social, scientific, and religious ideas -- are simply a ‘superstructure’, resulting entirely from the economic system (the system of ‘material production’)
   * Marx thought that all the “culture” just like a building, and these cultures are built based on the economic system
