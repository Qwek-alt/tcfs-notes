# Main Ideas in Stoic Philosophy
## (I) Science and Rationality
* Stoics emphasise rationality — the rationality of Man, the rationality of God, the rationality of Nature. There is rationality in all matter and all substances. Nature itself is rational, not organic
* Empiricism
  * All knowledge comes through the senses and experiences 
  * The soul at birth is blank 
  * All knowledge comes through the sense and experience 
  * Stoics are empiricists 
  * God is the single, active principle which governs the universe
## (II) God and Man
* Stoics say 
  * there is one god in the universe: The Supreme Being 
  * God’s rationality governs the universe and it comes into the world and mixes in with everything 

  |God's rationality mixes in with...|to..|
  |:--|:--|
  |Living things|animated them|
  |Non-living things|give it shape and form|
  * All men are given a rational soul 
  * the capacity for rational thought
* Stoics say all men have a unified soul but Aristotle believes that man's soul was divided into parts
* Emotions
  * An emotion is a wrong decision, a flase judgement of man's rationality
  * Emotions can be corrected by rationality
## (II) Ethics
* Natural Law 
  * God’s rational law govern the universe 
  * Unwritten law of human rationality, present everywhere there are humans 
  * The unwritten law of human rationality is a universal standard of justice prior to and superior to the laws of individual states 
  * Because man is rational, he is able to know this standard of justice ad he can decide to live by it 
  * The moral person 
    * chooses to live in agreement with God’s rational law 
    * chooses good over bad 
> Summary
> * The objective (or end) of. Life is moral goodness and wisdom, the qualities of God 
> * Philosophy and religion are closely linked in Stoicism 
> * People who choose not to live in agreement with God’s rational Laws are fools 
## (IV) Political Theory
1. Stoics favour Monarchy 
   * Rule by one wise man 
   * King has moral obligation to rule his people wisely and morally 
2. Stoic political theory is international 
   * Rejected Aristotle’s conceptual division of humanity 
   * Rationality is common to all people 
     * Greeks, barbarians, slaves, free, men, women — all are rational 
   * A new idea: brotherhood of man 
   * Man connected with the whole of humanity: world community 
   * All people are citizens of the world 
     * The international state: Cosmopolis 
   * A new moral value: Philanthropy 
     * Rational choice to live for one another and love one another
