# WHY DOES FRANCIS BACON CRITICISE ARISTOTLE IN THE *NOVUM ORGANUM*

During the Renaissance, Aristotle’s methods and concepts had gained many followers, which lead to virtually all of the universities founded at that time basing their system of philosophy on scholasticism; a form of Aristotelian thinking (Kuhn, 2018, para.10). Despite it’s large following, a few did oppose Aristotle’s ways, one of the most influential of them being Francis Bacon, who wrote the *Novum Organum*; in which, he laid out a new philosophy and methodology of science that he hoped would replace Aristotle’s *Organon* (the name given to the collection of Aristotle’s six books on logic and scientific method). In this essay, I shall argue that Francis Bacon was actually criticising Aristotelian logic and it's followers (the scholastics) in the *Novum Organum* because he is trying to convince people to move to his new method of inductive logic; which, unlike Aristotle's method of deductive logic, fulfils the purpose of science, which he believed was to make new discoveries and advance technology in order to serve practical uses and more importantly, to help people. He further strengthens his argument by stating four impediments to attaining truth with Aristotelian logic, known as idols. First the essay will examine why Francis Bacon is actually criticising Aristotelian logic and its followers instead of Aristotle himself. Next, it will evaluate the differences between Bacon and Aristotle's methods and purposes of natural philosophy. Finally, it will analyse Francis Bacon's visions for the future of science. `[The]`
 
First, I shall address the shortcomings of the question by explaining why Francis Bacon is actually emphasising criticism upon Aristotelian logic and its followers instead of Aristotle himself. Even though Aristotle was the source of Aristotelianism and thus its followers, he was not the one who made it so widespread. In aphorism 77 of the *Novum Organum*, Bacon (2017) does not actually believe that the widespread acceptance and agreement to Aristotle’s philosophy was even true and real because many followers had “delivered themselves over to it on the strength of the prejudices and the authority over others” instead of thinking “freely and independently” for themselves on this matter; forcing the pollutive spread of the limitations of Aristotle’s methods and concepts in educational institutions of that time - a situation in which Bacon found himself in when he was being taught scholasticism in university; a time that sparked his hatred for Aristotelianism. Furthermore, Bacon believed that Aristotle’s philosophy was an Idol of the Theatre: one of the philosophical dogmas created by previous philosophers (Bacon, 2020, sec.44 `[Ref]`). This Idol caused men to value antiquity and authority too highly; as Bacon believed that antique knowledge is old and had served its purpose in the past but has no place in the now (Bacon, 2017, sec.84). Essentially, Aristotle’s methods and concepts were handed down for generations and uncritically and blindly accepted (Broad, 1958, p.50). Thus, this led to the followers no longer thinking individually for themselves, no longer going out and exploring and just basing their findings on old, existing knowledge which was not even reliable. Therefore, it was the fault of Aristotle’s followers for trapping themselves in Aristotle’s texts, it was the fault of his followers for blindly accepting Aristotle’s principles and not thinking for themselves, and it was their fault for forcing these principles down to the next generations. Bacon hoped that he would be able to cleanse the minds of these followers by criticising them and the methods that they blindly obeyed. Consequently, Bacon’s criticism was motivated by the sheer volume of followers that Aristotle had accumulated, of which he believed were following the wrong path of natural philosophy and of which he had criticised.  
 
Another one of the key motivators to Bacon’s criticism was that Aristotle’s purpose of science did not align with his and this led to Bacon believing that many of Aristotle’s followers were wasting their time chasing the wrong finishing-post (Bacon, 2017, sec.81). Aristotle saw the purpose of science as to explain “why things were the way they were” (Fleischfresser, personal communication, May 12 2020) through answering the questions of the four causes and debating on these topics for lengthy periods of time; a pursuit for explaining existing knowledge to gain personal fame and glory. Bacon, however, believed that science could provide power and control over nature, and that man should be motivated to make new scientific discoveries that served practical benefits to the whole of mankind for eternity; a pursuit for improving the well-being of humanity through co-operative endeavours (Bacon, 2017, sec.129; Losse, 1992, p.7; Rossi, 1968, p.36; Boas, 1962, p.250; Broad, 1957, p.49; Dear, 2009, pp.57-59; Fleischfresser, 2020, p.4)`[Evi]`. Essentially, Bacon looked to “command nature in action, not to overcome an opponent in argument” (Klein & Giglioni, 2016, sec4). This contrast in purpose thus led Bacon (2017) to mark his criticism on Aristotle’s followers in aphorism 81, stating that “a great majority...of supposed scientists...are merely hired [as] lecturers...in pursuit of money or fame or the like”. Bacon watched his peers essentially waste their time debating on subjects that served no purpose; working in isolation from each other, fearing that if their results were stolen, they would no longer receive the credit that they yearned for. Bacon, however, felt that “co-operative inquiry” and collaboration was the only possible route to achieve the purpose of science (Losse, 1992, p.72). Therefore, Bacon’s criticisms were motivated by his passion towards using science for the betterment of humanity instead of for the purposes of Aristotle and his followers. `[Arg]`
 
Another driving force to Bacon’s criticism was the contrast between the methods that the Aristotelians used and the methods that Bacon used to derive truthful knowledge. Bacon despised Aristotle’s ideas on deductive reasoning, not only because it was a direct contradiction to his methods of inductive reasoning, but also because he felt that it was more suited to disputation than for the discovery of practical facts. Additionally, Bacon saw syllogistic reasoning, which is a form of deductive reasoning that was widely used at that time, as “utterly useless for discovering the laws of nature and for applying them to the solution of practical problems”, which, as discussed before, was Bacon’s prime purpose for science. (Broad, 1958, p.51). This is because the general premises of which reasoned the conclusion were derived too rashly and were drawn from flawed observation, or worse, no observation and experimentation at all; he called this phenomenon the ‘anticipation of nature’. Furthermore, Bacon saw Aristotle’s procedures of syllogism as being circular: the premise of the syllogism was also a conclusion that had to be supported by premises; a process that would go round and round forever, never achieving any form of practical application (Dear, 2009, p.4; Bacon, 2020, sec.31). His solution was his method of inductive reasoning which started with the collection of data, followed by methodical, inductive investigation which produces applicable, practical knowledge (Klein & Giglioni, 2018, sec.5). Therefore, Bacon heavily criticised Aristotle’s method of deductive reasoning, as it did not serve the purpose of science and was highly inaccurate to deriving truthful facts and this criticism, he hoped, would convince the people of his time to use his method of inductive reasoning. 
 
Other than that, Bacon was against the fact that `[Arg]` Aristotle had combined natural philosophy with theology as he believed that they deserved to be separated from one another. This is evident in aphorism 65 and 89, as Bacon (2017) describes that natural philosophy is corrupted by superstition and theology (the study of the nature of God and religious truths) and blames the “procedures of theological schoolmen” (the scholastics) for stunting the growth of natural philosophy with religion, which held great power within men of that time. The incorporation of religion into natural philosophy caused the creation of imaginative views on science that could not be founded on a rational basis. Instead, Bacon suggests that nature and religion are complementary to one another as “religion displays God’s will, while natural philosophy displays his power” (Bacon, 2017, sec.89). Additionally, if all works of natural philosophy had to coincide with religion, many logical theories and concepts could no longer be formed; thus, religion was limiting the abilities of natural philosophy (Bacon, 2017, sec.89). Therefore, Bacon criticised the mixture of natural philosophy and theology that brought great harm to the works of natural philosophy and held the opinion that the two should be kept separate. 
 
`[Eva]` Lastly, Bacon’s criticisms were for the reader, who was hopefully a follower of Aristotle, to wipe clean of their current beliefs on natural philosophy in preparation for proposing his new method for searching truth, which comes in the second part of the *Novum Organum*; a first step to ultimately creating the utopian future of science which he outlined in the Nova Atlantis. The society of Bensalen in the Nova Atlantis was a blueprint of Bacon’s ideals of what science actually was, how scientific research should be carried out and how science and religions could be kept separate, yet still existed in harmony (Klein & Giglioni, 2016, sec.7); rewritten through literary Greek myths to mask his crass propagandistic motives. In order to fulfil this goal however, Bacon had to convince the people of his time that their current methods were wrong and that his was right. Being a lawyer, he did so through a series of arguments opposing the current beliefs of the people that had been standing for centuries. In the *Novum Organum* as he writes, “my hopes [are] that this will make the truth more accessible, make the human intellect more willing to be cleansed and to dismiss the idols” (Bacon, 2017, sec.61). Furthermore, *Novum Organum* was just one out of the six-part work on science and its philosophy and methods, which was called the Instauratio magna, meaning the Great Fresh Start. Hence, Bacon was hoping to convince his readers to take the first step to building the future of science: to wipe the supremacy of Aristotle’s methods and concepts that had been standing for centuries thus far and start fresh in preparation for reading the ideas of the future.  
 
Therefore, Bacon’s criticisms of Aristotle's followers and the logic that they pursued in the *Novum Organum* was motivated by his intense belief that the purpose of science was to control nature and make new scientific discoveries for the betterment of humanity; achieved through the use of his method of induction, experimentation, co-operation and practical application. It can be said that he had at least partially achieved his goal, because even though his exact methods were not widely used, his ideas did manage to inspire more scientists to challenge the supremacy of Aristotelian scholasticism and emphasize practical application and experimentation - leading concepts of the Scientific Revolution.
