# The Empire
* Begins at the end of The Republic (27 BCE) 
* Augustus - the first princep 
  * Has combined power of older magistrates - tribune and censor 
* Other magistratecies still exist 
# Augustus' Changes
* Romans claimed to be conservative 
* MORAL REFORM 
  * One way to look conservative - promote traditional morality 
    * Eg. Laws to stop cheating between wife/husband 
  * Not sure if he actually agreed to the law 
* RELIGIOUS REFORM 
  * Brought back forgotten rituals 
  * To seem conservative 
  * Greek gods 
* GOVERNMEMT REFORM 
  * Augustus takes more direct control over provinces 
  * More beurocracy

    * Prevent crime and fires 
  * Rome built of wood 
* MILITARY REFORM 
  * More professional standardised army 
  * Army become loyal to central figure (him) instead of toward their general 
    * Prevent Civil War 
# Military/Government Reform
* Princeps controlled important provinces 
* Loyalty of the army was needed to become emporor 
* So the legions eventually came to have great power 
* Augustus made sure they were loyal… 
* … but over time they instead controlled many later emporors 
* Augustus moved many legions around - so that soldiers wouldn’t settle down and loyalty get broken 

# Ideology of the Principate
* The princeps/emporors: 
  * Emphasised continuity, not change 
  * Disguised their absolute power, pretended that the people rules Rome 
  * Presented themselves in propaganda as saviours of the republic, not destroyers 
  * Were usually shown in imperial propaganda as ideally *virtuous* rulers 
    * Eg. Paintings with them reading books = they smart, stories of them fighting = they heroic/know how to fight ~ thus, they are the best possible person to rule 
# When does the Empire End?
* 395BC? Probably Not 
  * Empire split into two 
    * Same country with two leaders and two regions and same government 
* 476CE? 
  * German king conquers Rome (Western Empire) 
    * But Rome is not really the centre 
* 1453CE? 
  * Eastern Empire invaded by Turks 
# Empire Divided
* Emperor Diocletian 
* Decides empire is too big to rule 
* Creates diarchy… in 286CE 
* Then tetrarchy in 293 
  * Two senior emporors entitled 'Augustus' 
    * Two junior emporors entitled 'Caesar' 
    * failed cause they faught 
* After Theodosius I dies in 395, he splits the Empire to East and West, with each son ruling one half 
* Technically they are still the joint rulers of one country… 
* …but Rome is never reunited and the western half collapses in 476CE

  * Get a Roman name
  * (Augustus wasn't born in Rome) 
    * He came from Italy - was an enemy of Rome - ended up as a citizen --> ruler 
    * Gave them more human resources 
    * More taxes 
    * Gave citizens legal rights 
# Religion and Mortality
* Relationship with imperialim 
* Helped to justify rule by the princeps 
* Roman religion has multiple Gods - peygenism 
  * No absolute list of gods/holy book 
  * More gods can be added 
  * Eg. Someone can invade a country and say - my gods are also your gods 
  * Princeps added people as Gods 
    * Eg. Julius Caesar - after dead, was called a God 
      * Then, Augustus was the son of God 
        * He was also a priest 
    * Didn't work with Jews 
* Imperial cult 
  * Worship of emporors after they die 
  * Temples were built to do so 
# Government
* Republic: elected officials ran provinced and the government 
* Emprie: beurocracy expanded, carrer officials instead of temporary elected ones 
* Increasingly centralised, but with strong local systems in each province 
* These local systems are inherited by later societies, such as the Muslim empires in the east and Christians in the West 
# Religion - Paganism
* Roman paganism -- aslo called Roman polytheism 
* No salvation  
  * Little focus on afterlife 
* History is seen as repetitive, no belief in progress 
# Christianity
* Romans early on didn’t really understand Christianity and made fun of it 
  * Christianity was minority 
* Monoetheisic 
* Was seen by Roman Leaders as a challenge to traditional authority 
* Early convents in Rome often mixed it with paganism 
  * Eg. Tomb stone (primary source) Fish was a symbol of christianity instead of the cross 
# Constantine
* First Christian emperor 
* Moved capital to Constantinople 
* Empire officially converted to Christianity in 380CE under Theodosius I - paganism was banned 
# [Tutorial] *Res Gestae*
* How reliable is Augustus’ own explanation of his actions?
* Consider these following claims from Augustus’ Res Gestae (List of Achievements). Provide an evaluation including brief context where useful. Is he correct in what he tells us?
* You should show quotes from both Augustus and the other primary sources.
* Use the following symbols to score each of Augustus’ claims: you can use more than one if you think that it is not clearly just one category.
  * 😀Yeah
  * 🤔Hmmmm…
  * 🤦🏻‍♀️Nah…
  * 💩Bullsh*t!
1. 🤦🏻‍♀️“I did not accept the Dictatorship which was offered to me both by the people and the Senate.” [Section 5]
   * Dictator: the term used to describe Augustus when he took power indefinitely instead of 6 months
   * Dictator: sole leader 
     * “In an extreme national emergency, a ‘Dictator’ (who acted like a sole consul without limitations on their power) could be appointed for a six-month period” 
   * Tacitus 1.10 “he forced the reluctant senate to make him consul”
   * “He used forces given to him by the senate against the state”
   * He was not officially known or labelled as a “dictator” but he did end up taking the role of a sort of dictator when he was a princep
     * He had the combined power of older magistrates, tribune and censor
   * “He decided that to divide the responsibilities of government among several people would place his life in danger, and endanger national security: so he did not do so.(Suetonius, 1979)

2. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤔“When I was victor I spared all citizens who asked for mercy. In the case of foreign peoples whom it was safe to pardon, I preferred to let them live rather than killing them.” [Section 3]
   * “He showed no generosity to his beaten enemies” (Suetonius, 1979)
     * In Suetonius, he watched a father and son beg for their lives and watched both of them die
       * Contradiction to “preferred to let them live rather than killing them”
       * However, we do not know the context of the father and the son - we don’t know if it was dangerous/unsafe to spare their lives
   * “Augustus’s generosity to all classes was displayed often” - he would offer interest-free loans with his excess money and sold grain to citizens at a cheap rate during food shortages”
   * “Augustus took vengeance on many people, meeting all attempts to make excuses with the reply: 'You must die! (Suetonius, 1979)

3. 🤔“For this service….I was called Augustus…on account of my courage, clemency, justice and piety. After that time, I had more influence than anyone else, but had no more power than my colleagues.” [Section 34]
   * “In the second battle he showed both skill as a commander and courage as a soldier” (Suetonius, 1979)

4. 💩”By new laws on my initiative I reintroduced many traditional moral standards which were going out of fashion in our time, and I myself set an example for people of the future to imitate in many matters.” [Section 8]
   * “He also introduced a law punishing adultery with quite harsh measures as a way of encouraging Romans to uphold moral obligations” (Andrewes, F & Purchase, W, 2020)
   * “Not even his friends could deny that Augustus often committed adultery” (Suetonius, 1979, p. 20)
