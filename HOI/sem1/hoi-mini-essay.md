# WAS THE 'FUNRAL ORATION' JUST POLITICAL PROPAGANDA?
In 431BC, the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta had just broken out. By the end of that year, many soldiers had died in the war and a Funeral Oration, with Pericles making a speech, that was held in their honour (J. Barlow, 2020). I will argue that the Funeral Oration’s central aim was to influence and encourage the citizens of Athens to fight in the Peloponnesian War, meaning it is mostly political propaganda. However, it was not just propaganda because it was also fulfilling the tradition of honouring the soldiers who have fallen and showing empathy to those who remained. 

With many soldiers already dead within the first year of the Peloponnesian War, more soldiers had to be recruited for Athens to have a fighting chance against Sparta; therefore, Pericles used this opportunity of addressing the public to encourage and influence the crowd to fight in the war like the men being commemorated before them. This is evident when Thucydides reports Pericles as saying, “It is for you to try to be like them” (Thucydides, 2020, p.17). With “them” referring to the soldiers who have passed in war, Pericles was not just praising them but putting them on a pedestal of example that the crowd should follow, manipulating them into recruiting and sacrificing like “them”. Pericles took advantage of the opportunity to address the public by encouraging them to duplicate the actions of the soldiers before them to produce more soldiers for the war. 

Even though the main goal of the speech was to influence the Athenians, Pericles was still able to fulfil his duty in continuing the tradition of the soldiers who were the first to die in the war. This is evident in how he praises the men as Thucydides records him stating “I have sung the praises of our city; but it was the courage and gallantry of these men, and of people like them, which made her [Athens] splendid” (Thucydides, 2020, p.17). This sentence is high praise for the men who died in war as Pericles announces that their bravery was what made Athens great and was above all the strong traits of Athens that he had mentioned before that. Ultimately, Pericles’ speech was not solely political propaganda as he does do his duty of praising the dead in tradition. 

Other than that, Pericles also showed empathy to the crowd, namely to the parents of the dead and the widowed women. Thucydides makes clear that Pericles wanted to supply comforting information to the parents of the dead by reemphasizing that their children’s sacrifice was extremely honourable and empowered the widows who were often overlooked by others. This shows that Pericles cared about the people of Athens and was supporting them while they grieved. Essentially, with this action having no political ties, Pericles’ Funeral Oration was not entirely political propaganda. 

Therefore, the Funeral Oration’s served various purposes, although it’s central aim was to spread political propaganda, it also fulfilled the tradition of honouring the fallen soldiers and showed empathy to those who remained.
