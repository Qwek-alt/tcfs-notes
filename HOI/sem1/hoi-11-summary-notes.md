# The Scientific Revolution

# Medieval Intellectual Life
* Centred around 'scholasticism' - "the great synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy and Christian theology" (Aquinas in Summa Theologica) 
* Natural philosophy turns into modern science 
* Major impact on natural philosophy was: 
  * Use of deductive logic 
  * 'Four causes' 
    * Material Cause 
      * The matter from which the thing is made from 
      * Eg. The wood of a wooden chair 
    * Efficient Cause 
      * The agent that bring something abour 
      * Eg. The carpenter 
    * Formal Cause 
      * The kind of thing that something is 
      * Eg. The shape of the chair --> chair category 
    * Final Cause 
      * The goal or purpose that a thing moves toward 
      * Eg. To sit on 
    * Aristotlelianism sought to generate the kinds of causal explanations for things in the world using the four causes 
    * Knowing things in the scholastic medieval period meant knowing why things were the way they were 
  * Empiricism 
    * Aristotelianism was based on logic and empiricism:  
    * Generally, empiricism means: sensory knowledge of the world was the proper philosophical knowledge was based on 
    * Aristotelian empiricism: be familiar with things 
      * Eg. We are familiar that rocks fall towards the Earth - we didn't go out and test this, but we all have memories that every time we dropped a rock, it fell toward the Earth 
      * These generalisations are the starting point to Aristotle's logic 
    * Aristotelian natural philosophy does not question whether our knowledge was correct - It assumes that what we know must be knowledge 
    * Syllogism - form of deduction 
  * Ideas about the Cosmos 
* Aristotelian Natural Philosophy 
  * Was trying to explain common knowledge 
  * It was not concerned with new discoveries 
  * It was not about new knowledge, it was about explaining things you already knew 
  * Natural Philosophy was very closely linked to theology. Medieveal scholastics used Aristotelian natural philosophy to explain the works of God
