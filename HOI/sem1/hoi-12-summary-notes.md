# Background to the Reformation
* Up to 1517, Chrictianity in the west was synonymous with the Catholic Church 
* Pope was leader of Christianity 
* Religious faith based upon emphasis on afterlife (eternal), rather than this life (fleeting) 
* To get to heaven (salvation) you needed to follow the teachings and instructions of the Church 
* This included performing works of piety 
  * Acts of penance and charity 
* Chuch dominated hope of salvation - without the Church, you couldn't get to heaven 
  * "You MUST follow the Church," said the Church 
  * But once people were able to read the Bible they realised 
    * No where in the Bible does it say that we have to follow the Church 
    * Nowhere in the Bible does it say that there is a Pope 
* Some reformas in late Middle Ages, although fundamentally still the same structure (ie. Salvation through he Church) 

# The Reformation
* In the early 1500s, and Augustinian monk named Martin Luther began to question the Church's monopoly on salvation 
* When analysing the Bibe, he didn't find anything in it to suggest that Christians had to go through Church to get to heaven 
* Came to conclusion while working as Professor in Wittenberg that humans could not influence their own salvation by good/pious works, but rather, that they were saved through God's grace alone (ie. Salvation was a free gift granted by God to the faithful) 
* This meant that the traditions and practices (rites) of the Church (including the sale of indulgences) were unncessary to one's spiritual well-being 
* One only needed to believe in god and the redemptive power of Christ to be saved. Good works, Luther believed, were things that Christians did because they had been saved through God's grace; they were not things that people did to be saved 

# Some of the Key Ideas of Protestantism Include:
* Finding salvation through faith alone, rather than through good works (sola fide) 
* An emphasis on reading Scripture rather than following Church tradition (sola scriptura) 
* All Christian believers equal before the clergy; ie. 'a priesthood of all believers' 
* A reduction of the Sacraments from seven down to two (Baptism and Communion) 
* Luther published 95 theses in 1517 against the problems and perceived abuses of the Church (including sale of indulgences) 
* While Luther initially wanted to reform the Church (remember that he was an Augustinian monk), this quickly developed into a break with the Church and a call for a thorough religious reorganisation along new lines. For this reason, 'Reformation' a little misleading 

# Spread of the Reformation in Europe
* The Reformation spread throughout Europe via print; and also through the political support that some German rulers showed Lither 
* Political fragmentation In German lands facilitated an opposition between nobilty who converted to Lutheranism and those who remained Catholic 
* This allowed the development in the 16th and 17th centuries of massive conflict 
* Period from 1520s - 1640s a period of great instability and war in Europe, in part fuelled by religious division: 
  * Peasants' War (1524-25) 
* During the 16th C, Protestantism spread throughout Europe. In Switzerland, we see it split into further groups (confessions) 
* Branches of Protestantism 
  * Lutheranism 
  * Zwinglianism 
  * Calvinism 
  * Anglicanism 
* Zwinglianism (disagreed with Luther over transubstantiation) and Calvism (ascetic form of Protestantism, rejected any emphasis on outward trappings of worship/religiosity - eg. No images, sculptures, music, rites in Church) 
* Protestantism also spread to England. Initially used as a tool by which to attain political and dynastic ends (eg. Henry VIII) 

# Outcomes of the Reformation
* Presented a major challenge to primacy of Catholic Church 
* Facilitated increased inddependence of European rulers (Protestant) from the powerof the Catholic Chuch (eg. Henry VIII and Elizabeth I of England) 
* Started the gradual development of 'pluralism' 
  * 'pluralism': the idea that there could be multiple approaches to Christianity 
  * Related to the idea of 'toleration', which began to develop in 17th C (England), and continued to develop into the 18th C (eg. Dutch Netherlands)
