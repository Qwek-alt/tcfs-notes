# The Renaissance as Cultural Movement
* C. 1350-1600 
  * 'c' means 'around'/'estimated date' 
* French meaning 'rebirth' 
* A cultural movement centred around a revival of ancient Greek and Roman ideas, ideals and art forms - rediscovery 
* Did not develop uniformly across Europe 
* Began in Italy and spread northward. Renaissance in England arrived in 1500s 
* Since the Renaissance was a cultural movement, we see it span across different historical periods medieval (500-1500) - early modern (1500-1800) 
* Continued from Middle Ages: 
  * Importance on Christianity 
  * Aristotle 
  * Scholasticism 
  * Evidence: The Dome - innovation of architecture 
  * Huge church - christianity continues 
  * Inspiration came from Greek/Roman architecture 
    * Tried to immitate their architechture - read their engineering books to try to figure out how to build the Dome 
* Ouside the dome: 
  * David and Hurcules statues 
    * David = from christianity 
    * Hurcules = from pagan mythology 
    * Example of old next to new 

# Why did Renaissance begin in Italy
<sub>(details not required - just background info)</sub>
* Socio-political and economic contect 
* Rise of Italian city-states: cities that controlled the surrounding land and were self-governing 
* Not large kingdoms like England, France and Spain, but made-up of small states. Some were principalities, many ay least started out as city-states 
* City-states increasingly modelled themselves on ancient Republican ideals, eg. Florence, Venice 
* Although over time, these republics increasingly became principalities run by despotic rulers (dukes, duchesses) 
* Italian city-states had money from trade and banking 
  * Italy manufactures textiles (wool and lace) 
  * Italy is between east and west - China and India brought in silk and spices to Italy - sold with a lot of profit 
    * Families were able to get very wealthy because there were no 'overlord rulers' (no kings/queens etc.) that would take their money away and due to trade and banking. 
    * These Families became patrons of artists and scholars of the Renissance  
* City-states also possessed cultural and historical 'proximity' 
  * Italians were very close to their past - some people's ancestors were Roman soldiers/scholars etc. 

# Renaissance Humanism
* An intellectual movement that sought to explore texts of ancient Greece and Rome (these were being increasingly rediscovered through trade, cultural contact with the east - there were also active collectors) 
* A strong interest in ancient Greek and Roman ideals (eg. Moral virtue) 
* Led to an increased interest in education as a means of cultivating the whole person, rather than just a means of teaching a driscipline/set of knowledge

# Art & Architecture in the Renaissance
* A move away from rigid, gothic forms toward more "realistic human figures" 
* Development of perspective 
* Illusion of 3D shapes 
* An emphasis on movement and motion in sculpture, apinting, drawing etc. 
* The reemergence of classical (ancient Greek and Roman) 
* Continued importance of Christianity
