# Essay Plan
* Introduction
  * I will argue that the Funeral Oration’s [1] **central aim** was to **influence and encourage the citizens of Athens to fight in the Peloponnesian War** *through the emphasis on the greatness of Athens*, **meaning it is mostly political propaganda**. However, it was **not just propaganda** because it was also *fulfilling the tradition of honouring the soldiers who have fallen* and *showing empathy to those who remained*.  
* Body 1
  * The central, underlying aim was to influence and encourage the citizens of Athens to fight in the Peloponnesian War.  
* Body 2
  * However, the speech was also fulfilling the tradition of honouring the soldiers who were the first to die in the Peloponnesian War  
* Body 3
  * The speech was also made to show empathy to those who remained, most notably to the women and children  
* Body 4
  * Being a significant figure in Athenian democracy, he also took this opportunity to promote and highlight the greatness of the democratic system that has been put in place.
  * He emphasizes that no other city-state has put this in place – the Athenians are unique in this way  
  * And this is what makes them superior to other city-states  
  * They are free – and the enemies are not  
  * The text, being a simplified translation and only an extract of the whole speech, might not show all of Pericles’ motivations.  
* Conclusion
  * rephrase thesis statement
