# When was the medieval period?
* 500-1500. Divided into 3 periods: 
  * Early Middle Ages (500-1000) 
    * Period of change after end of Roman Empire 
    * Roman cultural legacy persisted 
  * Some people in the south still thought of themselves as Romans 
  * High Middle Ages (1000-1300) 
    * Period of development and expansion after the end of the Viking raid 
    * New culture 
  * Late Middle Ages (1300-1500) 
    * Development away from political, social and economic structures of the high MA toward new forms 
# 5th-6th Centuries (400s-500s)
* End of western half of the Roman Empire 
* Rise of the Frankish Empire - Conversion of rulers to Christianity 
* Emergence of the idea 'divine right of kings' 
* Idea of 'monarchy' 

# 8th-9th Centuries (700s-800s)
* Charles the Great (Chalemagne) becomes ruler of Frankish Empire 
* Viking raids into Europe begin 
* Climate change occurs - increase in temp. by 1-2 degrees 

# 10th-11th Centuries (900s-1000s)
* Viking raid eventually come to an end 
* Agricultual boom in the wake of the rise in temperature - leads to increase prosperity 
* Rise of 'manorialism' and according to some historians, 'feudalism' 
* Also, urbanisation starting again in parts of Europe 

# Eastern Roman Legacy (Byzantine Empire)
* Istanbul used to be called Constanople 
* Lasted nearly 1000 years longer than Westen part 
  * Westen Roman Empire ended in 5th Century (400s) 
  * Eastern Roman Empire ended in 1453 
* The eastern Roman emperors (aka. Byzantine emperors) perceived themselves as guardians of Christianity 
* Culture of eastern Roman court was partly Greek (writing, language) but also continues Roman legal and political ideas; and many aspects of culture in Byzantine Empire also Roman 

# Carolingian Empire (9th Century)
* Charles the Great's Emprire ((Charles the Great) Charlemagne -> Carolingian) 
* Political stablity; increase of trade and development of new trade networkds within the Frankish realm (created new coinage system to facilitate trade) 
* Expansion into eastern territories (Saxony); forced conversion to Christianity 
* Gave warrior class (known fas counts) land in return for service 
* Establishment of the court at Aachen as a centre of learning; biblical scholarship 

# 'Divine right of Kings'
* Kings were not just warlords, bit had been somehow sanctioned to rule by God, through his representative on Earth, the Pope 
* Pope seen as inheritor of Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven 

# Monarchy

# The Vikings
* Over time, they settled: the Rus in Kiev; Iceland, Greenland and Vinland (Newfoundland, Canada)  

# Monarialism
* More of a socio-economic system than one idea 
* The principle is tht people would work the land collectively; each would take a share of the produce and would share equipment and labour 
* The total area of land could be owned by a 'lord' who resided in a manor house. Tenants worked his holdings and gave him a share of the crops/produce as rent. Some tenats were free, and others not free (called 'serfs' (not slaves, although slaves did exist)) 
* Monarialsm was the basis of what some historians refer to as 'feudalism' 

# Feudalism
* There is no one definition of feudalism among scholars 
* Latin feudum = fief (Grant of land) 
* Two main definitions: 
* Feudalism as a political arrangement between members of the nobility. Kings granted land to lords ine xchange for military service; these lords then granted parts of their land to lesser lords; and so on. Anyone who holds land from someone else is known as a 'vassal' 
* AKA military arrangement between King and upper nobles in which he gives land and they give military support 
* Feudalism as a system that encompassed all of society. To quote marc Bloch, feudalism involved 'A subject peasantry; widespread use of the service tenement (ie. The fief) instead of a salary… the supremacy of the class of specialized warriors; ties of obedience and protection which bind man to man and within the warrior class, assume the distinctive form callsed vassalage; fragmentation of authority…' (cited in Brown 1974, p.1071) 
* AKA more than king and upper nobles - it is throughout society from king at the top to peasants at the bottom 

# Why Feudalism is a Contested Term
1. We don't have a singular definition of the term 
2. There was no concrete system of socio-economic dominance 
3. Not all part of Europe had decentralised political systems 
4. Not all tenants owned material obligations to their lords 
5. Not all areas of Europe owed allegiance to a lord (eg. Cities) 

# Urbanisation
* Began in 11th Century 
* City gave privileges (we can think of these as 'rights') to citizens 
* Priveleges embodied in the two charter, were granted to inhabitants of the city and generally allowed them to answer to no one except the city authorities 
* Cities were politically far freer than non-urban spaces, and were able o run their economic and civic affairs generaly free of interference 
* Could select their own leaders and make theyr own regulations. In return, they had to pay taxes 
* Cities offered social mobility 
  * Upward: wealthy citizens known as burghers 
  * Downward: Poor 
  * Vagrancy would be a hallmark of the late medieval era into the modern period 
* Cities brought back market-oriented economy as new trade routes developed and old ones were re-established 
* Increase of luxury goods (fur, jewellery, silk, expensive wine etc.) 
* Increase of commerce within cities: artisans (ie. Craftspeople), merchants and bankers 
* Cities required portable wealth (ie. Coinage) 
* Gold coinage too valuable so silver coinage dominated 
* Coinage difficult and inconvenient to transport safely; banks could assist with notes of transfer etc. 

# [Tutorial] Magna Carta
* Read the extract from Magna Carta. In your groups, using your iBook try to answer the questions about the Magna Carta in this handout (3 pages) 

1. What was Magna Carta? 
   * Magna Carta was an agreement forced on King John of England by rebellious members of the English aristocracy, known collectively as the Barons; setting out rights of the Lords and Knights (Andrewes & Pickering, 2020, p. 15)
2. What is the full name of the charter? (What is a charter?) 
   * Magna Carta Libertatum (Translation: “The Great Charter of Freedoms” or the “Great Charter”)
   * A charter is a written grant by the sovereign or legislative power of a country, by which a body such as a city, company, or university is founded or its rights and privileges defined
3. What are ‘rights’? 
   * A moral or legal entitlement to have or do something
   * “Rights dominate most modern understanding of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done” (Stanford University. July 9, 2007. Retrieved 2009-12-21)
4. What events lead to the sealing (signing) of Magna Carta? Who wanted it, who didn’t? What happened afterwards 
   * King John of England and the English lords came into conflict when the king tried to extend his personal power, make decisions not based on written laws or customs, and to demand taxes and services which lords saw as due to them. After a war with the King, the lords forced King John to sign the Magna Carta in 1215. (pg. 16)
   * After the signage of Magna Carta, the rights in the Magna Carta gradually extended to people other than the lords; Magna Carta became the foundation of many aspects of modern legal and political systems

6. Why is it so important in Western History? 
   * This is because it establishes the idea that everyone is subject to the law, and that everyone is granted the right to justice and a fair trial.
   * And also because it set a foundation of many aspects of modern legal and political systems to the point that a copy of it is kept on display at the Australian Parliament House, Canberra, as a mark of its importance to the Australian system of government (pg 16)
   * The document represents the desires of this social class. It also provides a glimpse of the way in which medieval society was organised and where power lay, the importance of religion, and the relations between men and women.
