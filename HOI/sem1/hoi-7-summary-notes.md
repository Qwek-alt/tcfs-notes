# Islam and Christianity
## Battle of Tours
* Umayyad army defeated in 732AD by the army of Charles Martel 
* This victory gave the Franks the supreme power in Western Europe 
* Was the furthest reach of the new Muslim empire (the Umayyad Caliphate) into Europe 
* Sometimes used as example of Christian vs Muslim conflict 
* But 
  * Charles Martel was not trying to defend Christianity 
  * He only agreed to help other Christians in exchange for being made their supreme ruler 
  * And the Christian leader that Charles agreed to help was Odo, who was under attack because he was allied to a Muslim ruler, who was fighting another Muslim ruler 
* Primary source proof of such: 
  * “Charles, princess of the Franks, destroyer of many monasteries, and thief of church funds for his own use, was consumed by a long period of agony and a fearful death”. 
  * Another Christian writer said Charles had been “dragged to hell” for his sins. 
## Charlemagne

* Karolus Imperator Augustus (“Charles the Roman Emperor”) 
* “Holy Roman Empire”

* Islam and Christianity now bordering each other and often in conflict 
* Two emperors, one Byzantine and one Frankish, both claiming to be legitimate 
* Pope gives legitimacy to monarchs in the west 
* Pope therefore gains power, separates himself from Eastern Roman Empire

> Summary:
> 
> * Christianity and Islam both originated from Judaism and have many differences from Ancient Paganism (Greek Gods and Godesses).  
> * Christianity believed that Jesus was the son of God and focused more on the morals instead of rituals. Saint Paul of Tarsus converted from Jew to Christian after seeing a light and helped make Christianity "universal".  The Bible is a mix of Jewish and early Christian documents - some churches' Bibles differ from each other. 
> * Muhammad is the Prophet of Islam, he was not 'a son of god' or a person to be worshiped, God spoke to him and he relayed the messages. The Qur'an is believed to be the words directly from god so it's Muslim's 'holy book'. Hadith is a collection of stories about Muhammad and his way of life and is not considered 'holy'.
